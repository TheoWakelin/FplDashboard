# GitHub Copilot Instructions for FplDashboard Project

## Project Overview
This is a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Dashboard application built with:
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8)
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript (in FplDashboard.UI)
- **Database**: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- **Testing**: xUnit for both unit and integration tests
- **ETL**: Background service for syncing FPL data

## Architecture & Patterns
- Clean Architecture with feature-based organization
- CQRS pattern with separate queries and commands
- Integration tests use test databases with seeded data
- Dependency injection throughout

## Code Standards & Conventions
- Use primary constructors for dependency injection
- Follow feature-based folder structure (`Features/{FeatureName}/`)
- Integration tests inherit from `BaseIntegrationTest`
- Use `DatabaseSeeder` class for test data setup
- Prefer record types for DTOs
- Use `ApiTestClient` for HTTP test calls
- Always validate compilation with `get_errors` after edits

## Database & Testing
- Integration tests use `DatabaseFixture` with isolated test databases
- Complex data seeding handled by `DatabaseSeeder` class
- Test data configuration in `TestConfiguration.TestData`
- Always seed required data for tests to pass
- Use AutoFixture for test object creation

## When Making Changes
1. Read existing code structure before making changes
2. Follow the established patterns (see PlayersController examples)
3. Update both implementation and tests when adding features
4. Validate changes compile and tests pass
5. Only add comments where absolutey necessary for clarity
6. Keep methods focused and concise
7. Use meaningful names for variables, methods, and classes. Do not shorten variable names
8. Ensure this file is updated with any new conventions or patterns
9. Commands you run should be valid for windows powershell.

## File Locations
- API Controllers: `FplDashboard.API/Features/{Feature}/`
- Models/DTOs: `FplDashboard.API/Features/{Feature}/Models/`
- Integration Tests: `FplDashboard.API.IntegrationTests/Features/{Feature}/`
- Database Models: `FplDashboard.DataModel/Models/`
- Test Infrastructure: `FplDashboard.API.IntegrationTests/Infrastructure/`

## Common Tasks
- Adding new endpoints: Create controller, models, queries, and integration tests
- Database changes: Update models, add migrations, update seeders
- New features: Follow feature folder structure with complete test coverage
